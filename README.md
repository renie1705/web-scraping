This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts book data from BooksToScrape.com, a website designed for practicing web scraping. The script uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to collect book titles, prices, and star ratings from both the homepage and all 50 catalog pages, totaling around 1000 books. The data is cleaned and saved into two separate CSV files: books_homepage.csv (containing books from the homepage) and all_books.csv (containing books from the entire site). It also uses pandas to preview the scraped data. This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn how to automate data collection from websites and structure it for further analysis. The script is optimized for Google Colab but can also be run locally with minor path modifications.
